# GoodReadsDataAnalysis
In this experiment, we investigate the effects of each feature of a book on it's average rating. 
Questions to pose for hypothesis are:

    Does the reoccurance of a book through different publications bias the rating?
    Does the ratings count and text review counts affect the rating
    Does the popularity of the author affect the rating?
